# allocate-address.sh — atomic creation-order address allocation for the vault.
#
# Reserves the next address of the form c-NNNNNN and increments the counter
# under an exclusive mkdir-based lock (portable: works on Linux and macOS
# without flock). On missing counter file, recovers by scanning the vault for
# the highest existing c-NNNNNN in page frontmatter and resuming from max+1.
# Never silently resets to 1 in a non-empty vault.
#
# Stale-lock recovery: if the lock directory exists but its owner PID is no
# longer alive, the lock is removed and acquisition retries. PIDs are written
# into <lock>/pid the instant the mkdir succeeds.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/allocate-address.sh           # prints the reserved address (e.g. c-000042) to stdout
#   ./scripts/allocate-address.sh --peek    # prints the next value without incrementing
#   ./scripts/allocate-address.sh --rebuild # recomputes counter from max observed and exits
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — success
#   1 — lock acquisition failed (another writer is holding the lock)
#   2 — vault-meta directory missing and cannot be created
#   3 — counter value corrupt or non-numeric
